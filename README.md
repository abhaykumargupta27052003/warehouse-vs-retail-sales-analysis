A Comparative Analysis of Warehouse vs. Retail Sales Performance Minor Project – INT375 | Data Science Specialization

Dataset Source This analysis is based on a public dataset sourced from Data.gov. The dataset includes comprehensive sales records over time, categorized by item types, sales channels, and suppliers.

Dataset Overview Rows: 307,000+

Columns: Year, Month, Item Type, Retail Sales, Warehouse Sales, Transfers, etc.

Item Categories: WINE, BEER, LIQUOR, NON-ALCOHOL, STR_SUPPLIES, and more

Why Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)? EDA is a critical initial step in any data science project. It allows us to:

Understand data distribution and structure

Detect missing or anomalous values

Discover relationships and patterns

Prepare data for further modeling or insights

Steps Performed in EDA: Cleaned data (missing values, duplicates)

Created Date and Total Sales columns

Performed univariate and bivariate analysis

Visualized trends using histograms, bar charts, line plots, and scatter plots

Project Objectives & Analysis

Monthly, Quarterly & Yearly Sales Trends Clear seasonality observed
Q2 and Q4 had highest average sales, likely due to seasonal demand

Retail vs Warehouse Sales Comparison Warehouse sales contributed ~75% of total sales
Retail showed steadier performance over time

Top-Selling Product Categories WINE and LIQUOR were top performers in sales revenue
BEER had high volume but moderate total value

Price vs Quantity Sold Correlation A negative correlation suggests that as prices increase, quantity sold decreases
Reflects consumer price sensitivity

Peak Sales Months November & December showed spikes in sales across categories
Likely driven by holiday season demands

Key Visualizations Histogram: Total Sales Distribution

Bar Chart: Sales by Item Type

Line Plot: Monthly Sales Trends

Scatter Plot: Price vs Quantity Correlation

Pie Chart: Channel-wise Contribution

Conclusion This EDA provided valuable insights into:

How different channels (retail vs. warehouse) perform

Seasonality in sales patterns

The role of product type and pricing on revenue and quantity

Customer behavior trends that can inform future strategy

It strengthened skills in:

Data preprocessing & cleaning

Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Analytical thinking and storytelling through data
